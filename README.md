# NMNIST-STDP-SpiNNaker

Implementation of a Spiking Neural Network model inspired by [Deihl et al.](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2015.00099/full) for digit recognition on the [N-MNIST dataset](https://www.garrickorchard.com/datasets/n-mnist) on the Neuromophic system [SpiNNaker](https://apt.cs.manchester.ac.uk/projects/SpiNNaker/) using the software package [sPyNNaker](https://github.com/SpiNNakerManchester/sPyNNaker).

## To-Do

- [ ] Get Accuracy.
- [ ] Hyperparameter tuning for digit recognition of 3 digits (5, 6 and 9).
- [ ] Hyperparameter tuning for digit recognition of all digits (0 to 9).
- [ ] Testing Larger Models (with larger population sizes)
